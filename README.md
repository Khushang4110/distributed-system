# distributed-system
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a distributed system built using modern tools and technologies. The system consists of the following components:

- **Frontend:** A responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a form for user registration and performs client-side validation.
- **Backend:** A Python-based RESTful API built using Flask. It processes requests from the frontend and interacts with a MySQL database.
- **Database:** A MySQL database initialized with a predefined schema and sample data.
- **Containerization:** All components (frontend, backend, and database) are containerized using Docker.
- **Orchestration:** The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using YAML configuration files.
- **Monitoring:** Basic monitoring is implemented using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub are used to manage code changes and collaborate.
